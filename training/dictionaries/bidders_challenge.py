def clear():
    # Using os.system() to execute the clear command specific to the operating system.
    os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')

    # DOS and Windows('nt'): Microsoft's DOS had the cls command to clear the screen. Windows, which initially started as a graphical layer over DOS, maintained a lot of command-line compatibility with DOS for ease of transition and backward compatibility. So, when Windows NT(New Technology) came about, it kept the cls command for clearing the screen.
    # Unix and Unix-like Systems: Unix is an OS that dates back to the 1970s. The command-line interface for Unix used the clear command. Many modern OSes, including Linux and macOS, are derived or inspired by Unix, so they keep the clear command for compatibility and tradition.
